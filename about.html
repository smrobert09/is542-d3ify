			<div class="bio">
				I'm Morgan.  I love books, computers, camping, and my family (not in that order). I am graduating in April of 2014 with a <em>Masters of Information Systems Management</em> from Brigham Young University.  I am blessed to <em>work with technology</em> everyday, finding new ways to make it useful in practical situations.  I love solving puzzles, which can make work feel more like play.  As for a secret passion, you should see me <em>Polka</em>.

			<div class="bio">
				I'm Kari Marie.  I love my spouse, my daughter, crafting, books, and the outdoors (yes, in that order). I graduated from Utah Valley University in April 2012 with an Associates in University Studies and a particular emphasis in Hospitality Management. I am lucky to be a full-time <em>domestic engineer</em> and have such a percocious daughter with whom to interact.  Her amazing capacity to pick up on things gives me plenty of motivation to <em>make crafts, games, and activities</em> to challenge her and help her to grow. One item never left at home? - my <em>camera</em>!

			<div class="bio">
				My name is Attie Mae. I am two. I like swings, swimming, cheese sandwiches, and snuggling with my daddie. I can sing lots of songs. My mommie takes me to the library and find <em>lots</em> of fun books. If I could have one thing, it would be a <em>heffalump</em>! I can tell you all about them.
